## Welcome to my new blog.

I wanted to update this blog as often as I can. Some people asked me how do I self taught myself something new. So I figured I could run a blog documenting how I learn something new. This site is not finished yet. I probably need another month to finish all of the styling & layouts.
  
What type of posts you'll find:
- Some new things I've learned
- My current interests
- Project updates/dev diary
- Random memes (probably)
  
Oh yeah, this site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) so I can use Markdown to author my posts instead of editing HTML files.
