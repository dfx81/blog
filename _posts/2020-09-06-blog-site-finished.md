## Hello again.

The blog development have finished. Before, most of the styling & layout wasn't finished yet. Mainly because I'm still wrapping my head around [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Now, there should be no more unfinished elements of the site remains. The site still looks rough around the edges, but I'll be ironing out most of the site design issues as time goes on.

Oh yeah, this site was built using Bootstrap. It's a front-end framework developed by the people at [Twitter](twitter.com) and focuses on responsiveness between mobile and desktop sites. Another post on that later.

That's all for now!
